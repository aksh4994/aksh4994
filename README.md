- The objective of the research is to find out the most **relevant/risk factors of coronary heart
disease (CHD)** as well as predict the overall risk of having heart disease in the next 10 years
with a dataset involving a subset of population from the town of Framingham, Massachusetts.
This is achieved using a **Logistic Regression model** explained in the paper.

- Logistic regression is a type of regression analysis in statistics used for the prediction of the
outcome of a **categorical dependent variable** from a set of predictor or independent variables.

- In logistic regression, the dependent variable is always **binary**. Logistic regression is primarily
used for prediction and calculating the probability of success. 

- The **backward elimination approach** or the P-value approach will be used to eliminate attributes out of the 15
independent variables in the given dataset and that have the least impact on the regression
test. Thereby evaluating the statistics of only the potential risk factors causing heart
disease. 

- These findings are then interpreted using Confusion Matrix to understand the impact
of each risk factor on the variable to be predicted i.e.., the 10-year risk of coronary heart
disease in each patient.
