Based on the statistics, USA car usage is 286 million motor vehicles. We need car to fulfill our daily errands and staying in USA without car is a nightmare. 
Gas vehicles are only option in initial days, but people got electric vehicles as another option to think since 1985.

Electric vehicles evolving daily and coming with new features and multiple options. Companies encouraging their employees to take electric vehicles to promote green energy and providing subsidiaries. Ultimately customers are confused to choose between traditional/gas vehicles and electric vehicles.

Both Gas and electric vehicles have their own advantage and disadvantages. In the current project, we would like to go through the historic data and predict the car usage and prescribe the car (electrical or gas) considering multiple options.
