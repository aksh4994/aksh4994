The core idea of the **Genetic Algorithm** is to encode a solution as a chromosome and assign each chromosome to an organism. Then derive how fit the corresponding organism is for its environment, based on how good a solution is. 

Fitness, in turn, is a proxy for the chances of an organism to reproduce and pass its genetic material to the next generation through its offspring. Like in nature, the alpha-individuals of a population, the stronger (or faster, or yet smarter) ones, tend to have a higher chance of surviving longer and finding a mate. 

The resulting cross-product after mutation is declared to be the best solution for the problem that is being optimized [3]. In the industry, genetic algorithms are used when traditional ways are not efficient enough.
